# MessageHub Core

**MessageHub Core is a TypeScript library that provides foundational classes, interfaces, and tools for handling and processing messages within domain-driven and AI applications.** This package offers a set of abstractions that make it easier to manage messaging workflows, including sending and receiving messages across different channels.

## Supported Packages

The `@messagehub/core` package supports several email service providers, including:

- **Mailgun**: Integration with the Mailgun email service for sending emails.
- **Nylas**: Integration with the Nylas email service for sending emails.
- **Resend**: Integration with the Resend email service for sending emails.
- **SendGrid**: Integration with the SendGrid email service for sending emails.

### Adding New Providers

To add a new email provider, you can implement the `EmailProviderFactoryInterface` and `EmailSenderInterface`. Hereâ€™s a brief example of how to implement a new provider:

1. **Create a New Folder**: Create a new folder for your provider (e.g., `packages/myprovider`).
2. **Implement the Factory**: Create a factory class that implements the `EmailProviderFactoryInterface`. This class should have a method to create an email sender instance.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   import { MyProviderEmailSender } from './Provider/MyProviderEmailSender';
   import type { TypeMyProviderConfig } from './Type/Types';
   import type { EmailProviderFactoryInterface, EmailSenderInterface } from '@messagehub/core';

   export class MyProviderEmailProviderFactory implements EmailProviderFactoryInterface<TypeMyProviderConfig> {
       public async createSender(config: TypeMyProviderConfig): Promise<EmailSenderInterface> {
           return new MyProviderEmailSender(config);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Implement the Email Sender**: Create a class that implements the `EmailSenderInterface`. This class should handle the logic for sending emails.

   Example:
   ```typescript
   import type { TypeEmailMessage, TypeEmailMessageResponse, EmailSenderInterface } from '@messagehub/core';

   export class MyProviderEmailSender implements EmailSenderInterface {
       constructor(private config: TypeMyProviderConfig) {}

       public async send(message: TypeEmailMessage): Promise<TypeEmailMessageResponse> {
           // Implement the logic to send the email using your provider's API
           // It is recommended to use transformers and types for consistency
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Use Transformers and Types**: It is recommended to use transformers and types to ensure consistency in the data being processed. This helps maintain the expected structure and format across different email providers.

### Folder Structure

The folder structure for each package typically includes:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the package, including:
  - `Factory/`: Contains factory classes for creating email providers.
  - `Provider/`: Contains classes that implement the email sending logic.
  - `Transformer/`: Contains classes for transforming email messages to the required format.
  - `Type/`: Contains type definitions and interfaces.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the package.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the package.
- `.env`: Environment variables for configuration.

## Installation

Install the package using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @messagehub/core
```

## Features

- **Unified Messaging Interfaces**: Define consistent interfaces for handling message-related actions, such as downloading attachments, sending messages, and handling webhooks.
- **AI Integration Ready**: Tools are designed to wrap actions and services, allowing them to be easily integrated into AI workflows, especially with structured validation using Zod.
- **Extensible and Reusable**: Easily extend the provided base classes and interfaces to fit your specific messaging needs.

## Usage

### Sending an Email

The `sendEmail` function is the primary method for sending emails. It can be used as follows:

```typescript
import { sendEmail } from '@messagehub/core';

const emailMessage = {
  from: [{ email: 'sender@example.com', name: 'Sender Name' }],
  to: [{ email: 'recipient@example.com', name: 'Recipient Name' }],
  subject: 'Hello from MessageHub',
  text: 'This is a test email sent using MessageHub.',
  html: '<p>This is a test email sent using MessageHub.</p>',
  attachments: [
    {
      content: 'base64-encoded-content',
      filename: 'attachment.txt',
      path: '/path/to/attachment.txt',
    },
  ],
};

const config = {
  MESSAGE_PROVIDER: process.env.MESSAGE_PROVIDER, // any supported service from @messagehub/[MESSAGE_PROVIDER]
  RESEND_API_KEY: process.env.RESEND_API_KEY,
  RESEND_API_URL: process.env.RESEND_API_URL,
};

sendEmail(emailMessage, config)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Email sent successfully:', response);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error sending email:', error);
  });
```

### Configuration

Configuration for the `sendEmail` function can be defined in a `.env` file. The naming convention for the configuration variables is as follows:

- `MESSAGE_PROVIDER`: The email service provider (e.g., 'sendgrid', 'mailgun', 'resend').
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: The API key for authenticating with the Resend API, for Nylas it will be `NYLAS_API_KEY`, and so on...
- `RESEND_API_URL`: An optional custom API URL.

Example `.env` file:

```
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
RESEND_API_URL=https://api.resend.com
```

### Extensibility

The `@messagehub/core` package is designed to be extensible. You can create new email providers by implementing the `EmailProviderFactoryInterface` and `EmailSenderInterface`. This allows you to add support for additional email services in the future.

## Rationale

The `@messagehub/core` package is designed to provide a consistent and extensible foundation for managing messaging workflows in TypeScript applications. By using well-defined interfaces and tools, developers can easily integrate messaging capabilities into their domain-driven designs and AI-driven processes. The library also leverages Zod for schema validation, ensuring that the data being processed meets the expected structure.

## Serverless Focus

This package focuses on serverless (nodeless) environments, which is why it implements integrations with raw HTTP APIs.

## Installation & Setup

Install the package using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @messagehub/core
pnpm add @messagehub/resend
```

Ensure that your project is set up to handle TypeScript and supports ES modules, as this library is built with modern JavaScript standards.
